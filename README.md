# 🌀 Flow

**Enter flow state with your AI Agents.**

A **simple, minimal, and explicit** software development workflow for Cursor and compatible agents: `/flow-*` commands, TDD, subagents, verification gates, and worktrees.

## Quick start

```
/flow add email validation to the signup form
```

Flow suggests the next `/flow-*` command — **you invoke it** when ready.

## Commands

| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flow` | Not sure where to start — triage only; suggests one command, **you invoke it** |
| `/flow-debug` | Bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior — root cause before fixes |
| `/flow-patch` | Small bounded change (≤3 files, one concern) — micro-spec + **inline** TDD + per-task review |
| `/flow-brainstorm` | Idea still fuzzy — explore options and design before formal spec |
| `/flow-spec` | Clear feature or multi-step change — user-approved spec + AI self-reviewed plan |
| `/flow-execute` | Plan already approved — **subagents** run tasks with two-stage review per task |
| `/flow-verify` | Full test suite + requirements checklist + merge/push menu — auto-runs when execute or patch finishes; invoke standalone to re-check |
| `/flow-finish` | Merge locally, push, or close out — updates STATE, worktree cleanup, branch delete offer; use when user says "merge to main" outside the menu |

### Typical paths

| Situation | Path |
|-----------|------|
| New feature (multi-step) | `/flow-brainstorm` (optional) → `/flow-spec` → `/flow-execute` → verify → `/flow-finish` |
| Small fix (≤3 files, one concern) | `/flow-patch` → verify → `/flow-finish` |
| Bug or failing test | `/flow-debug` → `/flow-patch` → verify → `/flow-finish` |
| Plan already written | `/flow-execute` → verify → `/flow-finish` |
| Ready to merge or push | `/flow-finish` (or verify menu options 1–4) |
| Not sure where to start | `/flow` — suggests one command; you invoke it |

## Install

```bash
npx skills add gosukiwi/flow -a cursor --skill '*' -y
```

Installs to `.agents/skills/` (project). Add `-g` for global (`~/.cursor/skills/`). From a clone: `make install` or `npx skills add ./skills -a cursor --skill '*' -y`.

### Optional: [clean-code-skills](https://github.com/gosukiwi/clean-code-skills)

Enhances `/flow-verify` option 3 with full style + correctness review. Without it, Flow uses the bundled `correctness-reviewer` (branch mode).

```bash
npx skills add gosukiwi/clean-code-skills -a cursor --skill '*' -y
```

## In your project

Flow writes artifacts in your repo — not in the skill package:

```
docs/flow/
  brainstorms/   # optional exploration briefs (tracked)
  specs/         # approved requirements (tracked)
  plans/         # self-reviewed implementation plans (tracked)
  STATE.md       # local session bookmark — add to .gitignore (agent offers on first write)
```

Specs, plans, and brainstorms belong in git. `STATE.md` is a per-checkout resume pointer (phase, branch, workspace) — gitignore it so worktree sessions do not pollute `main`. Flow offers to add the gitignore entry before the first STATE write.

## What to expect

- **You drive the workflow** — `/flow` suggests one next command; you invoke it when ready.
- **Scope picks the path** — small bounded change → `/flow-patch`; multi-step feature → spec then execute (see [Commands](#commands)).
- **Tests before merge** — verify runs automatically after execute or patch; you get a merge/push menu when things pass.
- **Branches and worktrees** — implementation stays off `main`; the agent asks before creating a branch or worktree.
- **Artifacts** — specs, plans, and brainstorms are tracked in git; `STATE.md` is local resume state (gitignore it).

## Contributing

This repo ships skills to `skills/` and tests under `tests/`. After editing skills:

```bash
make test
npx skills add ./skills -a cursor --skill '*' -y --copy
```
