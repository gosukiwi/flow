# 🌀 Flow

**Enter flow state with your AI Agents.**

## What it is

Flow is a spec-driven software development workflow for teams and solo developers working with AI coding agents. It is not an app or a CLI — it is a set of Cursor skills (`/flow-*` commands) that guide an agent through brainstorming, specs, TDD, review, verification, and merge.

**Assumes:** you are a software developer; your project uses **git** (feature branches, commits, merge/push); you work in **Cursor** (or a compatible agent environment with skills support); the agent can run your project's tests and edit the repo. **You** invoke each step — Flow suggests, you decide.

## Quick start

```
/flow add email validation to the signup form
```

Flow suggests the next `/flow-*` command — **you invoke it** when ready.

## What to expect

- **Describe the work** — one small change? `/flow-patch`. Several steps or a new feature? `/flow-spec` (see [Commands](#commands)).
- **TDD by default** — each task starts with a failing test, then implementation, then green.
- **Review built in** — work is split into tasks; each is reviewed one at a time (spec fit, then correctness) before the next. AI reviewers handle this as you go; when you're ready to merge, you can optionally review the full diff from the verify menu.
- **Verify before merge** — runs automatically when tasks finish (full tests + requirements checklist); you get a merge/push menu when things pass.
- **Branches and worktrees** — implementation stays off `main`; the agent asks before creating a branch or worktree.
- **Artifacts** — specs, plans, and brainstorms are tracked in git; `STATE.md` is local resume state (gitignore it).

## Commands

| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/flow` | Not sure where to start — triage only; suggests one command, **you invoke it** |
| `/flow-debug` | Bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior — root cause before fixes |
| `/flow-patch` | Small bounded change (≤3 files, one concern) — micro-spec + **inline** TDD + per-task review |
| `/flow-brainstorm` | Idea still fuzzy — explore options and design before formal spec |
| `/flow-spec` | Clear feature or multi-step change — user-approved spec + AI self-reviewed plan |
| `/flow-execute` | Plan already approved — **subagents** run tasks with two-stage review per task |
| `/flow-verify` | Full test suite + requirements checklist + merge/push menu — auto-runs when execute or patch finishes; invoke standalone to re-check |
| `/flow-finish` | Merge locally, push, or close out — updates STATE, worktree cleanup, branch delete offer; use when user says "merge to main" outside the menu |

### Example scenarios

**"I want to add OAuth login"** (new feature, multiple steps)  
Start with `/flow-brainstorm` if the approach is still fuzzy, then `/flow-spec` → `/flow-execute`. Verify runs when execution finishes; merge or push from the menu or `/flow-finish`.

**"Fix a typo in the error message"** (small, one concern)  
`/flow-patch` → verify → `/flow-finish`.

**"This test started failing after the deploy"**  
`/flow-debug` to find root cause → `/flow-patch` to fix → verify → `/flow-finish`.

**"The spec and plan are already approved"**  
Skip straight to `/flow-execute` → verify → `/flow-finish`.

**"Tests pass — merge to main"**  
`/flow-finish`, or use the merge/push options from the verify menu.

**"Not sure where to start"**  
`/flow` — it suggests one next command; you invoke it.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add gosukiwi/flow -a cursor --skill '*' -y
```

Installs to `.agents/skills/` (project). Add `-g` for global (`~/.cursor/skills/`). From a clone: `make install` or `npx skills add ./skills -a cursor --skill '*' -y`.

### Optional: [clean-code-skills](https://github.com/gosukiwi/clean-code-skills)

Enhances `/flow-verify` option 3 with full style + correctness review. Without it, Flow uses the bundled `correctness-reviewer` (branch mode).

```bash
npx skills add gosukiwi/clean-code-skills -a cursor --skill '*' -y
```

## In your project

Flow writes artifacts in your repo — not in the skill package:

```
docs/flow/
  brainstorms/   # optional exploration briefs (tracked)
  specs/         # approved requirements (tracked)
  plans/         # self-reviewed implementation plans (tracked)
  STATE.md       # local session bookmark — add to .gitignore (agent offers on first write)
```

Specs, plans, and brainstorms belong in git. `STATE.md` is a per-checkout resume pointer (phase, branch, workspace) — gitignore it so worktree sessions do not pollute `main`. Flow offers to add the gitignore entry before the first STATE write.

## Contributing

This repo ships skills to `skills/` and tests under `tests/`. After editing skills:

```bash
make test
npx skills add ./skills -a cursor --skill '*' -y --copy
```
